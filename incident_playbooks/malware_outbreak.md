# Malware Outbreak Response Playbook

## 1. Detection
* **Initial Alert:** EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool reports multiple detections of the same or related malicious file hash across several endpoints (e.g., 5+ systems in 5 minutes).
* **SIEM Correlation:** SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel) triggers an alert for an unusual volume of external C2 (Command and Control) communication or high-entropy file operations.
* **User Report:** Multiple users report slow performance, unexpected reboots, or seeing ransomware notes.

## 2. Analysis
* **Triage:** Identify the malware family, initial access vector (e.g., email, unpatched service), and time of first infection.
* **IOC Collection:** Extract all associated Indicators of Compromise: file hash (SHA256), malicious IP addresses, domains, registry keys, and file paths.
* **Scope Assessment:** Determine the total number of affected endpoints and their business criticality.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Check collected IOCs against VirusTotal, Recorded Future, or internal blacklists for severity and known behaviors.

## 3. Containment
* **Network Isolation:** Isolate all identified infected endpoints from the network using EDR (e.g., Cortex XDR, Defender for Endpoint) or network access control (NAC).
* **Block IOCs:** Push firewall/proxy rules to block all identified malicious IPs and domains.
* **Suspend Accounts:** If any service accounts are suspected of being used in the spread, suspend them immediately.

## 4. Eradication
* **System Cleanup:** Remove all malware files, persistence mechanisms (registry keys, scheduled tasks, WMI persistence), and dropped payloads from isolated systems.
* **System Patching:** Identify and immediately patch the vulnerability or configuration weakness that allowed the infection (if applicable).
* **Credential Reset:** Force password resets for any users whose endpoints were compromised, especially local administrator accounts.

## 5. Recovery
* **Validation:** Run full anti-virus/EDR scans on all affected and potentially affected systems to confirm no residual malware.
* **Restore Access:** Reconnect cleaned and validated endpoints to the network one business unit at a time.
* **Data Restoration:** If data loss occurred, restore necessary files from the most recent known-good backup.

## 6. Post-Incident
* **Detection Improvement:** Create or update SIEM and EDR rules (e.g., Sigma rules) to detect this specific threat vector faster.
* **Forensics:** Preserve disk images or memory captures for deeper analysis by the forensics team.
* **Lessons Learned:** Document the full timeline, costs, and necessary process/technology changes in the Incident Report.
